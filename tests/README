To run the tests it's required a file called "credentials.ini" placed in this
folder. In that file you need to put your cliend id and your client secret
codes. You can get both from the Facebook Developer Page.

This is an example content of credentials.ini:
[Client]
ClientId=000000000000000
ClientSecret=00000000000000000000000000000000
