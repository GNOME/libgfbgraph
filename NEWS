LibGFBGraph 0.2

Just releasing under LGPG v2.1

===============
LibGFBGraph 0.1
===============

This is the first release of GFBGraph library.

With this library you can get:

        * a user node, knowing his node ID,
        * the "me" user node.
        * all albums owned by a user.
        * all the photos in an album, and download the image default size.

This version has a poor documentation and comes with a non-tested introspection.
